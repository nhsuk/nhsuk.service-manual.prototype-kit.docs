# NHS prototype kit documentation

This repository contains the content and code for the guidance website for the NHS prototype kit.

For the code for the NHS prototype kit itself, see [nhsuk-prototype-kit on GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit).

## Running the website

Start the code by running `npm run watch`.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to the NHS prototype kit guidance, then read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Style guide

We normally use the [NHS content guide](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content) for terms. But there are some terms that are only used in the guidance for the kit:

#### command line

Lower case. Only use for Windows instructions. Normally it will be ‘the command line’.


#### GOV.UK Prototype Kit, GOV.UK Design System and other GOV.UK products

Title case.

#### NHS, NHS.UK, NHS England


We are changing how we talk about tools for delivery teams. These used to be called 'NHS.UK' products but we are now removing the '.UK'. This means that we talk about the:

* NHS frontend (though this is still sometimes called 'NHS.UK frontend')
* NHS digital service manual
* NHS design system
* NHS prototype kit

For talking to the public about the website (find out more on the [NHS health writing A-Z](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/a-to-z-of-nhs-health-writing#N))


#### NHS England laptops

Use ‘NHS England Windows laptops’ instructions for people using corporate laptops.

#### NHS prototype kit

‘NHS’ is in caps and ‘prototype kit’ in lower case (except where it is shown next to the NHS logo when it is capitalised as ‘NHS Prototype kit’). Write out in full the first time it is used on a page, then call ’the kit’. Do not use ‘prototype kit’ if you can.

#### terminal

Lower case. Only use for Mac and Linux instructions. Usually it will be ‘the terminal’.

#### Visual Studio Code

Title case. When you use it for the first time in a guide, start with 'Visual Studio Code (also known as VS Code)'.
