## How you can contribute to the kit

There are many ways to contribute. You do not have to be an expert in coding.

You can:

- add or improve content for people using the kit
- do quality assurance or accessibility testing of new features or guidance
- fix bugs or build new features
- improve the contribution process

### Add or improve content for people using the kit

You can help improve the content for this website and the pages that people view when they download and install the kit.

This includes:

- making the guidance easy to understand and use
- writing in line with the [NHS content guide](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content) (including standardising terms for [the style guide for the kit in GitHub](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk.service-manual.prototype-kit.docs/blob/main/README.md))

Existing things we want to do for guidance are labelled [content on our project board in GitHub.]({{githubFilterQuery}}Content)

### Do quality assurance or accessibility testing

You can make sure that the code in our kit is robust and accessible by:

- running automated and manual tests against WCAG 2.2 AA specifications
- helping us set up pipelines for automated testing in GitHub

Accessibility issues are labelled [accessibility on our project board]({{githubFilterQuery}}Accessibility).

### Fix bugs or build new features

Known bugs that we need to fix are labelled [bug on our project board.]({{githubFilterQuery}}"%3Abug%3A+Bug")

Ideas for features are labelled [type: enhancement ðŸ’¡]({{githubFilterQuery}}"type%3A+enhancement+ðŸ’¡").

We also label bugs or features by the type of code skills needed: [JavaScript]({{githubFilterQuery}}Javascript), [Nunjucks]({{githubFilterQuery}}Nunjucks) or [SASS/CSS]({{githubFilterQuery}}SASS%20%2F%20CSS) .

### Improve the contribution process

We want to make the process of contributing as easy and as accessible as possible. Existing things we want to do to improve the contribution process are labelled [contribution process on the project board]({{githubFilterQuery}}%22Contribution+process%22).
