In your code editor, open your prototype folder. You will see the files and folders that you can edit in your prototype.

## Overview of folders in the prototype kit

`app` is for your work. Inside that folder:

- `views` is for HTML pages
- `assets` is for CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files
- `routes.js` is for advanced logic â€“ for example, if a user should go to one page or another based on their answers (we'll cover this later)
