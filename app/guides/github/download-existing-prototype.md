After you have [set up GitHub Desktop](/guides/github/setup-github-desktop), you can work with others on an existing prototype. For example, if you're joining a team that has a prototype.

## Download the prototype

To work on an existing prototype, you'll need to download (or 'clone') the repo.

1. Go to the prototype's repo on GitHub. If you do not have a link, ask your team.
2. Select the <kbd><samp>Code</samp></kbd> button and <kbd><samp>Open with GitHub Desktop</samp></kbd>.
3. Choose a local path. This should be your prototypes folder.

## Open the prototype

1. In GitHub Desktop, select <kbd><samp>Open in Visual Studio Code</samp></kbd>.
2. Go to the terminal in Visual Studio Code. Select <kbd><samp>Terminal</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp>New Terminal</samp></kbd>.
3. In the terminal, run <kbd>npm install</kbd>
