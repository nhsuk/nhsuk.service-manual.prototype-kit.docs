title: Set up GitHub and GitHub Desktop
order: 1
---

To use GitHub Desktop you need to follow these steps.

1. Install Git.
2. Create a GitHub account.
3. Download and set up the GitHub Desktop app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have never run the NHS prototype kit on your computer, finish the [get started guide](/install) first. This will mean that you have the right tools to complete these steps.

## 1. Install Git

The first thing you need to do is [install Git (opens in new tab)](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You do not need to set your name and email address now. You will do that later.

## 2. Create a GitHub account

Go to GitHub.com and [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

### If you work for NHS England

Code repositories or 'repos' for NHS England digital teams are usually stored in one of these shared accounts:

- [NHS.UK GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nhsuk)
- [NHS Digital GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nhsdigital)

Ask your development team or technical leadership where you should store your prototype.

It is usually easiest if you get your account added to the organisation first. An NHS England GitHub administrator must add you. Ask your team who to talk to.

## 3. Download and set up the GitHub Desktop app

[Download the GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).

Sign in with your GitHub account details.

You can now use GitHub Desktop to work with repos. A repo contains all of the files in a prototype. You can use the repo to view the file history and work on your prototype with other people.
