Before you start using the kit, you'll need some basic knowledge of HTML. You can learn this at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-fundamentals) or other tutorial websites.

There are 2 ways to use the kit. You can either install and run it on your own computer, or run it in the cloud and access it through a web browser.

> [!NOTE]
> If you’ve already got a prototype using the NHS prototype kit and need to upgrade it to the latest version, see the [guide to updating the kit](/install/updating-the-kit).
