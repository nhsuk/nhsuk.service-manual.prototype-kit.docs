## 1. Create a folder

{% if slug == "windows" %}
Create a folder called <kbd>Projects</kbd> in your <samp>Documents</samp> folder.
{% else %}
Create a folder called <kbd>Projects</kbd> in your home folder.

You can open your home folder by opening a new finder window and selecting <kbd><samp>Go</samp></kbd> and then <kbd><samp>Home</samp></kbd> from the top menu.
{% endif %}

## 2. Download the kit

The simplest way to get the kit is to [download it as a ZIP]({{downloadUrl}}).

You'll use a new copy of the kit for each new prototype you make. That way your prototypes don't interfere with each other.

## 3. Unzip the kit

Unzip the kit you downloaded. It should be in your <samp>Downloads</samp> folder.

You should end up with a ZIP file called <samp>nhsuk-prototype-kit</samp> followed by the version number.

Unpack that ZIP file by double clicking on it. You should then see another folder named <samp>nhsuk-prototype-kit</samp> followed by the version number.

## 4. Rename the folder

Rename the unpacked folder to something descriptive for your prototype.

For this guide, call the folder <kbd>find-a-pharmacy</kbd>

## 5. Move the folder

Move the folder into the <samp>Projects</samp> folder you created in step 1.
