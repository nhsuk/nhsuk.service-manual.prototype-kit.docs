## 1. Create a new prototype on GitHub

Follow the [Create a new prototype guide](/install/creating-a-new-prototype/) to create a new prototype using the template.

## 2. Create a folder

{% if slug == "windows" %}
Create a folder called <kbd>Projects</kbd> in your <samp>Documents</samp> folder.
{% else %}
Create a folder called <kbd>Projects</kbd> in your home folder.

You can open your home folder by opening a new finder window and selecting <kbd><samp>Go</samp></kbd> and then <kbd><samp>Home</samp></kbd> from the top menu.
{% endif %}

## 3. Download your prototype

The simplest way to download your prototype is to use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) application. Once you install this you can click on the ‘Code’ button on your project on GitHub, and then click ‘Open with GitHub Desktop’.

Alternatively if you use Visual Studio Code you can open a new window and select ‘Clone Git Repository’ and then paste in the URL of your prototype on GitHub.

You can also click the ‘Code’ button and select the ‘Download ZIP’ option – however if you do this you will not be able to synchronise your changes as easily with Git.
