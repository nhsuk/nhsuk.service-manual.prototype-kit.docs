Node.js is very easy to install.

The kit is designed to work with Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version 20 or higher.

## 1. Check if you have Node

In the {{cli}} enter: <kbd>node --version</kbd>

If it says:

- <samp>command not found</samp>
- <samp>'node' is not recognised...</samp>
- <samp>Error 0x2 starting node.exe --version</samp>
- or another number such as <samp>0.12</samp> or <samp>5.x.x</samp>

Then you will need to download and install the LTS version 20 or higher.

### If the version number starts with an 20 or higher

You have the correct version installed and can go to [step 3](/install/{{slug}}/text-editor).

## 2. Downloader and install Node.js LTS version

Download the LTS version 20 or higher.

Run the installer with all default options.

[Download and install Node.js (opens in new window)](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## 3. Check if Node is installed properly

You'll need to quit and restart the {{cli}} to be able to use Node for the first time.

To check it is installed correctly you can run <kbd>node --version</kbd>.

If it's installed correctly it should show a number starting with an 20 or higher:
