The kit is built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses [NHS frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend).

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20 or higher.

## Create a new prototype

The best way to create a new prototype is to [use the template repository on GitHub](/install/creating-a-new-prototype/).

If you do not want to use GitHub you can [download it as a zip]({{downloadUrl}}) instead.

## Install dependencies

<kbd>npm install</kbd>

## Run the kit

<kbd>npm run watch</kbd>

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
