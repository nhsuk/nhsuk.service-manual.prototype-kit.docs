This avoids the need to install Node.js on your computer. Instead, you will run the kit in the cloud and edit the code in your web browser.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is free for around 60 hours per month

## Before you begin

You do not need any technical knowledge to use this guide.

You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out) and should have already followed the guide to [create a new prototype](/install/creating-a-new-prototype/).

We will show you how to:

- set up the Codespace
- work with the Codespace

Installation usually takes up to 5 minutes.
