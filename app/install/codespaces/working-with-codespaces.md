description: If you are using the browser to edit the kit, you need to manage changes in Codespaces.
---

## Save changes

Changes you make are not shared with anybody else until you commit them to Git and push them to the repository.

You can use the Codespace code editor and user interface to manage changes with GitHub. You can use the [quickstart guide for working with Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart#committing-and-pushing-your-changes).

## Manage prototypes

When a Codespace is deleted, you will lose any changes you have not committed and pushed to a repository.

GitHub Codespaces are automatically deleted after they have been stopped and have remained inactive for a defined number of days, default is 30 days.

## Publish prototypes online

Codespaces are temporary and do not usually have passwords. You will need to use a different service to [publish your prototypes online](/guides/publish-your-prototype-online).

## Get going

[Build a basic prototype](/guides/build-basic-prototype) or [view other guides](/guides).
