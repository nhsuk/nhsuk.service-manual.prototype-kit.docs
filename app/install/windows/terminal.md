You'll use the Command Prompt to install, start and stop the kit.

To open the Command Prompt:

- Click Start
- In the Search, type <kbd>cmd</kbd> (short for command) or <kbd>commandprompt</kbd>, and press Enter.

When you open the application, it will contain text similar to this:

```shell
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]

```

Once you have it open, keep it open and go to step 2.
