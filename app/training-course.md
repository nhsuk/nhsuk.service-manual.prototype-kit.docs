The course is an in-person alternative to our [online tutorial](/guides/build-basic-prototype/) and covers: 

* setting up a new prototype using GitHub 
* using a code editor like Visual Studio 
* an introduction to HTML
* how to use Nunjucks components from the NHS design system 
* adding 'branching' to a service using using Javascript

The course is run regularly and is open to anyone who works for the NHS, including interaction designers, content designers and other roles.

Priority is given to NHS England employees.
