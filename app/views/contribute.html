      The NHS prototype kit is a community project supported by the NHS service
      manual team. Anyone can help make it better.

    <h2 id="why-contribute-to-the-kit">Why contribute to the kit</h2>
    <p>Help keep the kit up-to-date as an accessible and open way to make HTML prototypes of NHS services.</p>
    <p>By contributing you will become part of an active and supportive community that will help you learn and develop your skills with the kit.</p>
    <p>We will credit you in our update notes and other supporting information, unless you tell us not to.</p>
    <p>
      If you are employed by NHS England, you will usually be able to use
      examples of contributing to the kit as part of your yearly performance
      review - talk to your line manager about how to include it in your
      performance objectives.
