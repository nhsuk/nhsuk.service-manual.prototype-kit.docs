      Contribute to the NHS prototype kit
    </h1>
    <p>
      The NHS prototype kit is a community project supported by the NHS service
      manual team. Anyone can help make it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can view what the community is working on from our
      <a href="{{board}}"
        >open project board on GitHub</a
      >
      - if you cannot see this board then contact the service manual team and
      they will tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community work on the kit and its website are tracked on one shared
      project board but the code (&#39;code repositories&#39;) is in different
      places - you can view the code for the kit on the
      <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit/"
        >nhsuk-prototype-kit code repository</a
      >
      and the guidance on the
      <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk.service-manual.prototype-kit.docs"
        >nhsuk.service-manual.prototype-kit.docs code repository</a
      >
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-contribute-to-the-kit">Why contribute to the kit</h2>
    <p>If you contribute to the kit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        this keeps it up-to-date as an accessible and open way to make HTML
        prototypes of NHS services
      </li>
      <li>
        you will become part of an active and supportive community that will
        help you learn and develop your skills with the kit
      </li>
      <li>
        we will credit you in our update notes and other supporting information
        unless you tell us not to (for example, because you want to stay
        anonymous)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are employed by NHS England, you will usually be able to use
      examples of contributing to the kit as part of your yearly performance
      review - talk to your line manager about how to include it in your
      performance objectives.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-you-can-contribute-to-the-kit">

    <p>If you are confident with code you can create issues with GitHub.</p>
    <p>
      The team and wider community usually review new issues at least once a
      week and will add comments about what will happen next.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also have weekly alignment meetings on
      a Monday afternoon at 4pm which are optional but helpful if you want to
      check with a person - ask the service manual team for an invite.
