        How to use layouts
      </h1>


    <p>Layouts let you share a common design across pages. For example, to include the name of your service or use the NHS.UK footer on every page in your service.</p>
<p>If your pages share a custom header and footer, you can add them to one shared layout file. To change those parts of the page in future, you can change them once and they will update on all the pages that use that layout.</p>
<p>To make a page use a layout, you need to add an <code>extends</code> line at the top of the file. For example if you want to extend a layout called admin, use:</p>
<p><code>{{'{% extends "layouts/admin.html" %}' | escape }}</code></p>
<p>The Prototype Kit comes with a layout file for you to edit. You can also add more layouts if you need to.</p>
<h2 id="adding-layouts">Adding layouts</h2>
<p>In your code editor, open <code>app/views/layouts.html</code>.</p>
<p>Note the line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" class="app-pre"><code class="language-markup">{{'{% extends "template.html" %}' | escape }}
</code></pre>
<p>It means this layout extends a standard layout that comes with the Prototype Kit. It loads the default code needed for NHS.UK branded pages, along with the functionality in the kit, such as automatically storing data.</p>
<p>You can make changes to existing blocks and define your own blocks in your layout.</p>
<h2 id="using-blocks">Using blocks</h2>

<p>Blocks are named sections of a page.</p>

<p>For example, in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/page-template">NHS page template</p> there are blocks defined for <code>header</code>, <code>content</code> and <code>footer</code>.

<p>You can use these in your layouts to set different areas of the page.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/page-template#options">NHS page template options</a> for a full list of all the defined blocks.</p>
<h2 id="stylesheets-css-and-javascript">Stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript</h2>
<p>You can use custom layouts to load your own stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript on multiple pages. <a href="/how-tos/adding-assets">Find out more about adding CSS and JavaScript</a>.</p>
