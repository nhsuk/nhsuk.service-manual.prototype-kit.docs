<p>In your code editor open your prototype folder. You will see the files and folders that you can edit in your prototype.</p>
<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Overview of folders in the Prototype Kit </h2>
<p><code>/app</code> is for your work. Inside that folder:</li></p>

<ul>
    <li><code>views</code> is for HTML pages</li>
    <li><code>assets</code> is for CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files</li>
    <li><code>routes.js</code> is for advanced logic - for example, if a user should go to one page or another based on their answers. We'll cover it later.</li>
    <li><code>/docs/views/templates</code> has template pages for you to copy into your prototype</li>
    </ul>
