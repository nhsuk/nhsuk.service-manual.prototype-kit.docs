      <h1>Publish your prototype online</h1>
      <p>Publishing your prototype online means you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>share it with others, such as colleagues</li>
        <li>test it with users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll need a hosting service to publish prototypes online.</p>

      <h2>Hosting services</h2>
      <p>The NHS prototype kit runs on any hosting service that supports Node.js. This means it does not run on 'static' hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.</p>    
      <p>Your organisation may already use a hosting service for the prototype kit. Check with your digital team about which platform to use.</p>
      <h3>If you are using GitHub to store your code online</h3>
      <p>Many hosting services have an option to automatically update your published prototype every time you push new changes to the connected GitHub repository.</p>
      <p>This includes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration">Heroku (GitHub Integration)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://railway.app/new/github">Railway (deploy repository)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other ways to get your code onto a hosting service</h3>
      <p>Usually you can connect your code using Git. Use our <a href="git">Git guide</a> and then instructions from your hosting service (for example, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli">Railway</a>). </p>

     
      <h2>Setting a password</h2>
      <p>When running the prototype kit online, you must set a password. This is to stop anyone accidentally finding your prototype and mistaking it for a real service.</p>
      <p>To set a password, check your hosting services documentation on how to set "environment variables". (It may have a slightly different name like "config vars" or "variables".)</p>
      <p>The password should be set using the variable <code class="app-code">PROTOTYPE_PASSWORD</code>.</p>

      <p>If you are using an older version of the prototype kit (before v4.12.0) you will also need to set a username using the variable <code class="app-code">PROTOTYPE_USERNAME</code>.</p>

      <p>Read more about environment variables for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://catalins.tech/heroku-environment-variables/">Heroku, on the Catalin's Tech website</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.railway.app/develop/variables">Railway</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If Railway is your hosting service</h2>

      <p>You need to do some extra things to run your prototype online using Railway.</p>


      <p>Add 2 more environment variables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a variable called <code class="app-code">NODE_ENV</code> and set the value to <code class="app-code">production</code></li>
        <li>a variable called <code class="app-code">USE_AUTH</code> with the value of <code class="app-code">true</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You also need to set the command to get started. Go to Settings > Deploy and set it to <code class="app-code">npm run start</code>.</p>
