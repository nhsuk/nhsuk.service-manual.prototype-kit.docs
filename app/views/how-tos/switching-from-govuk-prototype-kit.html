        Switching from the GOV.UK prototype kit
      </h1>


<p>
      If you have learned how to use the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a>, you will be able to use the NHS.UK prototype kit. This is because the two prototype kits are built in the same way. However, you must do some things differently.
    </p>
<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Installing and running the NHS.UK prototype kit</h2>

<p>
When you are installing and running your prototype:

{{ list({
  title: "Do",
  type: "tick",
  items: [
  {
    item: '<a href="/install/download-zip">download the kit using the zip file or Github</a>'
  },
    {
      item: 'start your local server by entering in the terminal: <pre class="app-pre"><code class="language-markup">npm run watch</code></pre> '
    }
  ]
}) }}

{# removed for now as don't need the multiple versions problem
{
  item: 'check when you install your prototype that you are using the right version of Node.js - you may need to install and use a different version. If you need to make prototypes for both NHS.UK and GOV.UK you can switch versions of node with a <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">node version manager</a>'
},
#}

{{ list({
  title: "Don’t",
  type: "cross",
  items: [
  {
    item: 'try to create a prototype by running a command in the terminal - you must download it'
  },
    {
      item: 'start your local server the same way as in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit as it will not work'
    }
  ]
}) }}



<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Making pages</h2>

<p>
  When you are making pages:
</p>

{{ list({
  title: "Do",
  type: "tick",
  items: [
    {
      item: 'use the NHS.UK design system for <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles">styles</a>, <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components">components</a> and <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns">patterns</a> - you can also copy <a href="/page-templates">template pages in the NHS prototype kit</a>'
    },
    {
      item: 'use <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS.UK macro naming conventions</a> which do not have a prefix, for example <code class="language-markup">{{ radios }}</code> instead of <code class="language-markup">{{ govukRadios }}</code>'
    },
    {
      item: 'use <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/typography">NHS.UK typography classes</a> on headings and other text, for example <pre class="app-pre"><code class="language-markup">' + '<p class="nhsuk-body">nhsuk-body</p>' | escape  + '</code></pre>'
    },
    {
      item: 'know that the NHS.UK prototype kit does not have some functionality that is in the GOV.UK one, for example the interface to create pages from templates'
   },
   {
      item: 'know that plugins designed for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit may not work or may need to be installed differently - for example, if you want to use the <a href="https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-filters/get-started/">GOV.UK Prototype Kit Filters plugin</a> you must use instructions for earlier versions of the kit and make changes in <code class="language-markup">filters.js</code>.'
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ list({
  title: "Don’t",
  type: "cross",
  items: [
    {
      item: 'copy pages from the GOV.UK Prototype Kit or GOV.UK Design System and expect them to work - you may need to copy over extra code like CSS to make them work properly'
    },
    {
      item: 'use GOV.UK macro naming conventions or GOV.UK typography classes as they will not work'
    }
  ]
}) }}
<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Using routing and session data</h2>

<p>You can define routes to do branching logic or other custom behaviour in the same way as the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.</p>

<p>You can also add default session data in <code class="language-markup">data/session-data-defaults.js</code></p>

<p>Unlike the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, if you save any changes the the routes file, the app will restart and any session data will revert to the default.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Publishing your prototype online</h2>

<p>Set the password using the variable <code class="app-code">PROTOTYPE_PASSWORD</code> - check the <a href="/how-tos/publish-your-prototype-online">guide to publish your prototype online</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Help and support</h2>
