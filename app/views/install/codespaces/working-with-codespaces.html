      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">If you are using the browser to edit the kit, you need to manage changes in Codespaces.</p>

      <h2>Save changes</h2>

      <p>Changes you make are not shared with anybody else until you commit them to Git and push them to the repository.</p>

      <p>You can use the Codespace code editor and user interface to manage changes with GitHub. You can use the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart#committing-and-pushing-your-changes">quickstart guide for working with Codespaces</a>.</p>

      <h2>Manage prototypes</h2>

      <p>When a Codespace is deleted, you will lose any changes you have not commited and pushed to a repository.</p>
    
      <p>GitHub Codespaces are automatically deleted after they have been stopped and have remained inactive for a defined number of days, default is 30 days.</p>

      <h2>Publish prototypes online</h2>

      <p>Codespaces are temporary and do not usually have passwords. You will need to use a different service to <a href='/how-tos/publish-your-prototype-online'>publish your prototypes online</a>.</p>

      <h2>Get going</h2>

      <p><a href="/how-tos/build-basic-prototype">Build a basic prototype</a> or <a href="/how-tos/index">view other guides</a>.</p>
