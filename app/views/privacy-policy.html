    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy covers what we
      collect and how we use, share and store your information.
    </p>
    <p>This page tells you:</p>

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>about the information we may collect</li>
      <li>how we keep your data secure</li>
      <li>who we share your data with</li>
      <li>about your rights to see or change information we hold about you</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Information we may collect</h2>
    <p>
      You can leave feedback on some pages of the website or on a user survey.
      You can choose to share your email address if you want a reply. Otherwise,
      we collect and store feedback anonymously
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Our website uses cookies. These are small files saved on your phone,
      tablet or computer when you visit a website. They store information about
      how you use the website, such as the pages you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law says that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly
      necessary to make our website work. For all other types of cookies we need
      your permission before we can use them on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read our <a href="/cookies">cookie policy</a> to find out more about the
      cookies we use.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sometimes use tools on other organisations' websites to collect data or
      to ask for feedback. These tools set their own cookies.
    </p>
    <h2>Why we need your data</h2>
    <p>
      For a number of the activities that we undertake to complete our function,
      we need to process personal data. We collect certain personal data when
      you use the NHS prototype kit.
    </p>
    <p>We collect your data so that we can:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>tell you about work and updates on the kit</li>
      <li>
        work with you on contributions, where youâ€™ve proposed to add or improve
        part of the kit
      </li>
      <li>
        support you, including both the provision of support and responses to
        user enquiries
      </li>
      <li>
        gather feedback, including gathering it to improve our services, and
        responding to it, if you have asked us to
      </li>
      <li>invite you to take part in user research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We collect your user profile if you interact with us on collaboration
      tools and platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>Keeping your personal data secure</h2>
    <p>
      We convert your data into secure code (encrypt it) and store it on secure
      servers in England. A partner organisation is providing hosting services
      but has no say in how the information is used. There are no legal ways for
      their employees to see the data. Only approved people in the NHS digital
      service manual team can see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you shared your email with us as part of a survey, we will delete it
      after 2 years. At that point no one can identify you in the survey data.
    </p>
    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      As part of NHS prototype kit we share your personal data with data
      processors who provide us with:
    </p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        software collaboration platforms when you share research, feedback or
        make a contribution
      </li>
      <li>support providers when you contact us for assistance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      NHS England may share anonymous information on how the service is used
      with the Department of Health and Social Care, integrated care boards
      (ICBs), and national governance groups.
    </p>
    <h2>Legal powers</h2>
    <p>
      When you give us personal information, we may pass it on if the law says
      we must.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you make a claim against us, we and other third parties such as our
      solicitors may need to look at this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not share your personal information with anyone else without your
      permission for any other reason.
    </p>
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>

        it's wrong, or delete it by emailing enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk
