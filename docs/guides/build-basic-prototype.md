Our fictional 'Order a test to check if you have magical powers' service will:

- ask 2 questions
- show the user's answers for them to check
- show a confirmation page

It will take about an hour to finish this tutorial, after you install the prototype kit.

Our prototype will look a bit like this:

![The first page has the title 'Start page' with the button 'Start now'. This is linked to a 2nd page with the title 'Question 1' and a 'Continue' button. This forks to 2 different pages. The first is titled 'Ineligible' and the second is titled 'Question 2'. Question 2 is linked to a page titled 'Check answers'. This links to page 6, titled 'Complete'.](/assets/images/guides/build-basic-prototype/overview.png 'Diagram of 6 pages connected together')

## Before you start

Before you start, you must [install](/install) and run the NHS prototype kit.

You'll also need a code editor. Any HTML text editor will do, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (also known as VS Code). This is because it is free and has lots of useful features.
