## Add a component

The prototype kit has 2 ways to use components. You can either use HTML or a Nunjucks macro.

You can copy the HTML or Nunjucks code from each of the components pages in the [design system in the service manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system).

The design system includes code snippets and guidance on how to use components.
