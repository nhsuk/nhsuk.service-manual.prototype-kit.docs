GitHub is a way to store code online so you can collaborate with others. It also makes it easier to publish your prototype online using a hosting service.

Terms we use include:

- Git – software that stores versions of your code
- GitHub – a website that shares your code online
- GitHub Desktop – an app that puts your code on GitHub, so that you can collaborate with other people in your team
- repository or 'repo' – a project stored in Git
- organisation – a shared account normally run by an organisation or community

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to use GitHub or GitHub Desktop, go to our instructions for [setting up Git using the terminal](/guides/git).
