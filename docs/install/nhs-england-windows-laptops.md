title: Set up the prototype kit on an NHS England Windows laptop
---

If you have a Windows laptop issued by NHS England corporate IT, before you start any of the install guides you will need to:

1. create a local folder in the right place for your code to work
2. install the software that you need

## 1. Create a local folder for your prototypes

Within the root of your OneDrive create a new folder named <kbd>DevWspace</kbd>.

This folder name is on an approved list so you can create virtual environments and execute scripts.

The path should look like this after you have created it:

<samp>"C:Users%username%OneDrive - NHSDevWspace"</samp>

Use this folder:

- for any prototypes that you make
- for any software for your kit that asks for a 'path' â€“ ask a developer on your team if you need help

## 2. Install the software you need to use the kit

Go to the Company Portal application to install this software:

- Terminal
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js and NPM
- Git for Windows
- Github Desktop

You may need to restart your computer to finish installing the software.

## What to do next

After you have finished these steps you can continue to the [install guide](/install/windows) or the [advanced install guide](/install/advanced).
